### Project Description

As our final project at Makers Academy - team BestB4 consisting of Eithel, Elsie, Jules, Mackenzie and Valeria had the challenge of changing the world in 8 days.  We came up with this - a website to help people waste less food by allowing users to easily give away food they won't use - or food that's about to expire - to other people in their local community. Here's our tasks based down into user stories-

```
As a user
So I can find unwanted food
I can view a list of available food

As a user
So I can access my account
I can log in

As a user
So I can create an account
I can sign up

As a user
So I can give away food I won't use
I can list a food item

As a user
So people can see who I am
I can add my gravatar profile picture

As a user
So I can find food available in my local area
I can see a list of food in my area
```

After having achieved our primary targets - we moved onto more ambitious ones - connecting our application to external API's. Firstly we used the Spoonacular API to allow users to see recipes based on what was in their own fridge as well as being given away by users in their local area-

```
As a user
So I can receive recipe ideas based on food items in my area
I can view a recipe suggestions
```

Once this goal had been attained we moved onto our final stretch goal - to allow users to see where their othe food was located. We did this using the google Maps API-

```
As a user
So I can see what items are available in my area
I can see items near my location on Google Maps
```

### Tests

#### How to run front end feature tests

1. Run back end server (from backend directory) <br>

$ BestB4 <br>

```
node server.js

```
2. Run front end server (from front end directory) <br>

$ client <br>

```
npm run start

```

3. Run Cypress (from front end directory)

$ Client

```
node_modules/.bin/cypress open
```

The Cypress UI will then open automatically and you will see a list of feature tests that can be run.
